<h1>My Favorite Classes In Pathfinder</h1>
    
<p>In pathfinder, you can play as a variety of different, powerful adventurers, each useful in their own right, and capable of amazing skills and feats. I chose to expound upon some of my favorites to play, the ones that in my opinion, are the very coolest</p>
    

    
<div id='Spiritualist'>
<h1>SPIRITUALIST: SPOOKY SCARY PHANTOM FRIENDS</h1>
<img src="imgghost.jpg">
    
<p>Spiritualist has to be my favorite new pathfinder class. It's like a summoning class, only lots spookier, as you become a caster capable of summoning your very own superb ghostly buddy~! With a variety of different manifestations, and possibilities for stories. Plus, the sucker's intangible. Nothing messes with your GM by having a ghost to scout out whatever carefully laid trap he set up for you </p>

<p>
Role:Buffer/Scout/Assault
Main Method Of Attack:Spells/GhostyFriend
Spells/Abillities: Spooky buffs and Debuffs, plus your Phantom's abillities
Perks: You have a ghost friend~! You can mess with people's heads, and scout easily
Try To Avoid: Really powerful spirits, enemy clerics, and anyone in a jumpsuit with a proton pack. 
</p>

<div id='Bloodrager'>
<h1>Bloodrager: ARCANE FIGHT CLUB</h1>
<img src="imgfist.png">
    
<p>The first rule about arcane fight club, you always talk about arcane fight club. Seriously, this is like, all the fun parts about being a sorceror, only all up close and personal, able to be delivered via fists, weapon, and various other </p>

<p>
Role: BURST/TANNK/SMASHER
Main Method Of Attack: MAGICAL RAGE SMASHING 
Spells/Abillities: Like Magic~! With your FISTS.
Perks: Not quite as powerful a spell caster as sorceror, but you're badass while you're raging, and you get all the wapons you wouldn't otherwise
Try To Avoid:  Getting stuck, or disabled. You am Hulk. You need smash, no get stuck
</p>    
</div>    
    
<div id='Gunslinger'>
<h1>GUNSLINGER: THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE GRITTY</h1>
<img src="imggun.jpg">
    
<p>Ah, this one's a bit odd to put up but... it's gunslinger man. You're smart enough and hardassed enough, that you make and keep up your own gun and ammo, in a land where they're not quite favored yet, and through bravery and daring, you can manage through sheer force of will and skill, to make shots that would be near impossible for others  </p>

<p>
Role: Sharpshooter/Damagedealer/Drfiter
Main Method Of Attack: Lead, or other such ammo, inserted into enemies at high velocities 
Spells/Abillities: No spells, but plenty of neat deeds to work with
Perks: Long range, and rewards for doing gutsy and cool stuff
Try To Avoid:  Running out of Ammo, and bringing a gun to a magic sword fight
</p>    
    
</div>
    
<div id='Shaman'>
<h1>SHAMAN: IT's LIKE, COMMUNING WITH THE SPIRITS, MAN. </h1>
<img src="imgshaman.jpg">
    
<p>Yeah, the Shaman's pretty groovy. You're whole deal man, is, like, talking to the spirits of nature, and gaining their powers. You get like, a little spirit animal dude to go around with you, some pretty neat powers, depending on what spirit your little nature bro embodies. Plus, you can like hex dudes who are being uncool to your party. You're toooootaly copasetic. </p>

<p>
Role:Blaster/Debuffer/Debuffer
Main Method Of Attack:Magic, Hexes, many of which are  deliverable via animal friend. 
Spells/Abillities: Spirit based magic, prepared at the start of the day, plus spiritual assistance and hexes. 
Perks: Solid all around spell caster, and you've got lots of spirit shennagans you can inflict on people. 
Try To Avoid:Bad Trips, Bad Mojo, Running Out Of Spells
</p>    
    
</div>
<div id='Alchemist'>
<h1>ALCHEMIST: BOMBS, BREWS, AND BEYOND</h1>
<img src="imgalchemy.jpg">
    
<p>Alchemists. I really love the alchemist. You don't have a huge amount of magical power, but what you've got, you make it work for you, in the very best ways. With this class you can explode things, you can mutate things, you can create all manner of things, only quite limited by imagination. </p>

<p>
Role: Artillery/SkillMonkey/Creator
Main Method Of Attack: BOMBS. SO MANY BOMBS. 
Spells/Abillities: Little Potions You make at the beginning of the day
Perks: Lots of Varieties of alchemists, and you can play them almost any way you want. 
Try To Avoid:  Getting Close. To anything. Seriously, you aint a melee guy~!
